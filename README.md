I built a conversational agent using Python 3.13.4 and LangChain 1.1.0, connecting it to the OpenAI language model. The agent can respond to user queries through a console interface, storing inputs and retrieving relevant context from memory implemented with a FAISS vector database. Prompt templates are used to provide context-aware responses, and a simple tool-based action, such as multiplication, is implemented to simulate reasoning and action within the conversation.
 
In this part of the project, I improved my agent by adding support for custom tools and making it capable of performing actions based on the user’s message. I created separate tool functions like a calculator and a simulated weather checker, and integrated them so the agent can detect tool keywords, run the correct tool, and return the result automatically. The agent now handles tool responses, fallback LLM responses, and also manages errors gracefully. This update makes the agent more interactive, flexible, and capable of combining normal conversation with tool-based operations
